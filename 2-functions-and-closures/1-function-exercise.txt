A) They are not hoisted
B) They can be called before definition *
C) They must be anonymous
D) They can’t return values

2. What is the output?
sayHi();
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
ANS: Hello!


3. What happens here?
greet();
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hi");
};

B) "function" +
C) "method"
D) "callable"

5. Which is a valid function expression?

B) function = let() {};
C) let function() {};
D) def function() {};

6. What is the difference between var and const function expressions?
A) Both hoisted fully
B) var-hoisted, const-temporal dead zone + ()
C) const-hoisted, var-blocked
D) No difference *
CORRECTION: var is hoisted (initialized as undefined), const is in the temporal dead zone until declared.

7. What is printed?
console.log(sum(2,3));
function sum(a,b){return a+b;}
ANS: 5

8. What happens?
console.log(multiply(2,3));
var multiply = function(a,b){return a*b;};
ANS: 6
CORRECTION: TypeError: multiply is not a function.

9. Which function type allows recursion?
A) Anonymous expression
B) Named expression +
C) Arrow function
D) Callback function *

10. What is the output?

  console.log("Declared!");
}
var test = function() {
  console.log("Expression!");

D) None

13. What is a key advantage of function expressions?
