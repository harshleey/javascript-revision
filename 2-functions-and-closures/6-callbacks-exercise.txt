🟡 MEDIUM LEVEL - JavaScript Callbacks
🔥 Question 1: Custom Array Filter with Callbacks
Build a custom filter function that:

Mimics the native Array.prototype.filter() method

Accepts an array and a callback function

Returns a new array with elements that pass the callback test

The callback should receive (element, index, array) as parameters

🔥 Question 2: Async Data Processor with Error Handling
Build an async data processor that:

Processes an array of data through async callbacks

Handles both successful and failed operations

Returns results and errors separately

Continues processing even if some operations fail

🔥 Question 3: Custom Array Map with Callbacks
Build a custom map function that:

Mimics the native Array.prototype.map() method

Accepts an array and a callback function

Returns a new array with each element transformed by the callback

The callback should receive (element, index, array) as parameters

Should not mutate the original array

🔥 Question 4: Batch Processor with Callback & Concurrency Limit
Build a batch processor that:

Processes an array of items in batches with concurrency control

Accepts array, processor callback, concurrency limit, and completion callback

Processes items concurrently but respects the concurrency limit

Calls completion callback with all results when done
