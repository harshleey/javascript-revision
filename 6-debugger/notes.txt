Debugging & Problem-Solving: A Quick Guide
The goal is to solve algorithmic problems methodically, without frustration.

1. Break It Down
Before writing code, split the large problem into smaller, manageable steps. Solve each step one by one.

Example: For "Sort a list of names," the steps might be: 1) Get the list, 2) Compare two items, 3) Swap them if needed, 4) Repeat until the whole list is sorted.

2. Trace Logic Manually
Be the computer. Take a simple example and walk through your logic step-by-step with a pen and paper.

Why it works: This exposes flaws in your reasoning before they become bugs in your code.

3. Use console.log() Effectively
Don't just guess; use console.log to see what's happening inside your code.

Where to log:

At the start and end of functions.

Inside loops (log the index and key variables).

Before and after critical conditional statements (if/else).

Pro Tip: Use descriptive labels: console.log("Loop i=", i, "value=", arr[i]);

4. Leverage the Debugger
Move beyond console.log with the powerful tools in Chrome DevTools or Node.js debugger.

Set Breakpoints: Pause your code on a specific line to inspect everything.

Step Through Code: Execute your code line-by-line to watch how variables change.

Inspect Variables: See the current state of all variables in the scope without cluttering your code.

Your Anti-Frustration Mantra: "Stop, Isolate, and Check." When you hit a bug, don't panic. Stop, Isolate the problem section, and Check your assumptions against what the code is actually doing.
