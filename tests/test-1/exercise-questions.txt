🟢 EASY LEVEL (5 Programs)
1. Temperature Converter
Build a function that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit
Test: convertTemperature(25, 'C') → 77
Test: convertTemperature(77, 'F') → 25

2. Simple Counter with Closure
Create a counter using closures that can increment, decrement, and reset
Test: After increment(), increment(), getCount() → 2
Test: After reset(), getCount() → 0

3. Grade Calculator
Write a function that takes a score and returns a letter grade (A-F)
Test: calculateGrade(85) → 'B'
Test: calculateGrade(92) → 'A'

4. Array Statistics
Create a function that analyzes an array and returns sum, average, max, min
Test: analyzeArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) → {sum: 15, average: 3, max: 5, min: 1}

5. String Reverser
Build a function that reverses a string without using built-in reverse()
Test: reverseString('hello') → 'olleh'
Test: reverseString('JavaScript') → 'tpircSavaJ'

🟡 MEDIUM LEVEL (5 Programs)
6. Shopping Cart with Closures
Create a shopping cart system using closures to manage items and total
Test: Add 2 apples ($1 each) + 1 banana ($0.5) → Total: $2.50
Test: Remove apple → Total: $1.50

7. Password Validator

Test: validatePassword('Abc123!') → {valid: true, errors: []}
Test: validatePassword('abc') → {valid: false, errors: ['too short', 'no uppercase']}

8. Todo List Manager
Create a todo list with add, remove, toggle complete, and filter functions
Test: Add "Learn JS", toggle complete → [{task: 'Learn JS', completed: true}]
Test: Filter active tasks → only uncompleted tasks

9. Digital Clock with Auto-Update
Build a clock that updates every second using setInterval
Test: Clock shows current time, updates every second automatically

10. Expense Tracker

🔴 HARD LEVEL (5 Programs)
11. Promise-based File Processor
Simulate file processing with async operations using Promises
Test: processFiles(['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']) → Processes files in sequence, returns results array

12. Memoized Fibonacci Calculator
Implement Fibonacci with memoization for optimal performance
Test: fibonacci(10) → 55 (fast even on repeated calls)
Test: fibonacci(50) → 12586269025 (efficient)

13. Debounce Search Function
Create a search function that delays API calls using debouncing
Test: Rapid typing "hello" only triggers one API call after typing stops

14. Custom Array Methods
Implement your own versions of map, filter, and reduce
Test: myMap([1,2,3], x => x*2) → [2,4,6]
Test: myFilter([1,2,3], x => x>1) → [2,3]

15. Module Pattern Library
Build a utility library using the module pattern with private/public methods
Test: MathUtils.add(2,3) → 5
Test: Internal helper functions are private (not accessible)
