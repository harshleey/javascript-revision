🧱 1. Core JavaScript Fundamentals ()
You should be 100% comfortable with:
Variables & Scopes (let, const, var, and scope rules)

Data Types (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, null, undefined)

Type Conversion & Coercion

Operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison, ternary)

Conditionals (if, else if, switch)
Loops & Iteration (for, while, for...of, for...in, forEach)

✅ Goal: You can manipulate arrays/objects and control loops without Googling syntax.

🔁 2. Functions & Closures
Understand:
Function declaration vs. expression

Arrow functions (=>)

Default parameters

Higher-order functions (functions as arguments/return values)

Closures — vital for understanding variable scope

Callback functions

✅ Goal: Be able to write reusable helper functions for array transformations or recursion.

🧮 3. Arrays & String Methods (Very Important for DSA)

These are used everywhere in coding challenges. You should know what they do and how to use them:

Array methods:

.push(), .pop(), .shift(), .unshift()

.map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .find(), .some(), .every()

.sort() (and custom comparator functions)

.concat(), .slice(), .splice()

Spread operator [...arr]

String methods:

.split(), .join()

.toLowerCase(), .toUpperCase()

.includes(), .indexOf()

.replace(), .substring()

✅ Goal: You can solve a problem like reversing a string or flattening an array easily.

🧩 4. Objects and Maps/Sets

Understand how to:

Loop through objects (for...in, Object.keys, Object.entries)

Use Map and Set for optimized lookups

Distinguish between shallow vs. deep copies (Object.assign, spread)

Use destructuring and rest/spread syntax

✅ Goal: You can use objects or maps to count frequencies or store key-value pairs efficiently.

🧠 5. ES6+ Features

These make your solutions cleaner and faster:

Destructuring

Template literals

Spread and rest operators

Default parameters

Optional chaining (?.)

Nullish coalescing (??)

const vs let semantics

Arrow functions

✅ Goal: You write clean, modern, readable JS code — not ES5 spaghetti.

⚙️ 6. Understanding “How JS Works”

You’ll need these for debugging and efficient thinking:

Call stack and execution context

Pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference

Event loop (sync vs async, micro tasks)

Time complexity (Big O notation basics)

Recursion and how the call stack behaves

✅ Goal: You can reason through why your code behaves the way it does.

💡 7. Debugging & Problem Solving

Use console.log() effectively

Use Chrome DevTools or Node’s debugger

Learn to trace through logic manually

Break large problems into smaller chunks

✅ Goal: You can debug algorithmic problems without frustration.

🧮 8. Basic Math & Logic Skills

For DSA, you’ll frequently use:

Modulo operations

Math functions (Math.floor, Math.max, Math.min, Math.abs)

Random number generation

Pattern recognition with loops

✅ Goal: Be comfortable implementing things like “check if a number is prime” or “reverse an integer.”

🚀 9. Optional But Useful:

Recursion patterns

Spread/rest in function arguments

Understanding of immutability

Familiarity with time complexity (O(n), O(log n), etc.)

🧭 Learning Path Suggestion

Here’s a good progression before LeetCode:

Start Codewars (Level 8kyu → 6kyu) to master JS syntax & tricks.
Focus on: arrays, strings, loops, conditionals.

Move to 5kyu+ challenges — start solving small algorithmic problems.

Then go to LeetCode (start with Easy problems under arrays, strings, and hash maps).
